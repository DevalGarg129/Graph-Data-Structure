📊 Graph Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)

A complete, structured repository focused only on Graph Data Structures, covering core concepts, standard algorithms, and interview-important problems, implemented with clarity and optimal approaches.

This repository is intended for:

DSA & interview preparation

Competitive programming practice

Strong conceptual understanding of graphs

🧠 What is a Graph?

A graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of:

Vertices (Nodes)

Edges (Connections between nodes)
